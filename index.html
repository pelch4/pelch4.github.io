<p>Well hello there! Thanks for dropping by my webpage! So, there isn't a whole lot here yet, but I imagine that will be changing as I progress through CIT 281 and learn more about web app developement.</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Past Coding Experience.</h3>

<p>I only started learning about coding about five weeks ago, and at that I had to jump right into it. I do think that I'm starting to get some idea of how HTML and Javascript work, though I still need more practice with CSS.</p>

<h3>
<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Other Stuff I do.</h3>

<p>Before I began learning about coding, I was (and still am) a journalism major. I have a developing interest in video production, and have produced a few projects, stories, and blogs. My earliest projects can be viewed on this <a href="https://blogs.uoregon.edu/pelchsu14gateway2/">website</a>. For reporting classes, I produced a couple small blogs that can be viewed <a href="https://blogs.uoregon.edu/pelchreporting1/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.pelch.wordpress.com">here</a>.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>More Casual Things About Me</h3>

<p>In my spare time I enjoy being outside to go camping, fishing, hiking, or just enjoy the sun. Having done cross country since I was little, I'm one of the few people who actually enjoy running. I also take food and Star Wars WAAAAAY too seriously, I just can't help myself.
